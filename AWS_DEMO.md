## Additional tweaking

- Application environment variables can be set via:

   *App Services* **->** *{WebServiceName}* **->** *Application settings*
- In order to connect WebService to the cloud VMs, we need to:
  - Create Virtual Network
  - Attach VMs network interfaces to that VirtualNetwork
  - Create Virtual Network Gateway for WebService
  - Attach Virtual Network Gateway to the WebService
- Connection to databases or storage blobs could be done via: 

   *App Services* **->** *{WebServiceName}* **->** *Data Connections*
- Exploring WebService guts could be done via:

  *App Services* **->** *{WebServiceName}* **->** *Advanced Tools*
